1) data,information,knowledge

Data:-Facts and figures which relay somthing specific, but which are not organized in any way 

information:-Contextualized,categorized and condensed data

knowledge:-understanding of a subject, synthesise information to gain knowledge about historical patterns and future trends

2)What is data mining?

• Is the search of relationships and global pattern that exist in large database but are hidden among vast amounts of data such as relationship between patient data and their medical diagnosis.
• Exploration & analysis, by automatic or semi-automatic means, of large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns

3)Explain or enlist step of KDD?

Knowledge discovery consists of an iterative sequence of the following steps:
• data cleaning: to remove noise or irrelevant data
• data integration: where multiple data sources may
be combined
• data selection: where data relevant to the analysis task are retrieved from the database
• data transformation: where data are transformed or consolidated into forms appropriate for mining by performing summary or aggregation operations
• data mining: an essential process where intelligent methods are applied in order to extract data patterns
• pattern evaluation: to identify the truly interesting patterns representing knowledge based on some interestingness measures
• knowledge presentation: where visualization and knowledge representation techniques are used to present the mined knowledge to the user

4)what is discriptive analysis & predictive analysis 


Predictive model makes predictions regarding data values using the results found from available data. Thus it makes use of historical data to make predictions

Descriptive model identifies patterns or relationships in data. It finds out the properties of existing data and does not predict the new properties

It targets the summarization and conversion of data into meaningful data for reporting and monitoring.
